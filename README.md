# API Interaction with Next.js

## Description:
This project demonstrates technical skills in developing a Next.js application that interacts with an external API. 

## Key features include:
- Fetching data from an external API (currency exchange rates).
- Handling asynchronous requests in Next.js API routes.
- Server-side and client-side rendering integration with Next.js.
- Proper usage of environment variables for sensitive API keys.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up the project on your local machine and get it running.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js: version v14.x.x or higher
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun for package management
- An API key from the ExchangeRate API (or a similar service).
