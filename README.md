## Description:
This project demonstrates technical skills in developing a Next.js application that interacts with an external API. 

## Key features include:
- Fetching data from an external API (currency exchange rates).
- Handling asynchronous requests in Next.js API routes.
- Server-side and client-side rendering integration with Next.js.
- Proper usage of environment variables for sensitive API keys.

3. #### Install the dependencies (I used npm, you can use whatever you prefer):
` npm install
` yarn install
